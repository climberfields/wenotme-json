# Wenotme

## What's the story?

Project Wenotme is an application that will allow you to track and post incidents as they occur. You will be able to retrieve live data from your police department that let's you know what crimes have been committed, where, and when. 

In phase 1 we are merely capturing the ability to see what crimes occured, when and where. You also have the ability to take a picture of a crime in progress and upload the picture so that it will aid citizens in protecting their neighborhoods and potentially assist police in their investigations. 

## Phase 2
